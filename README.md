## Description

The task was a challenge assigned to us where we had to take starter code for a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node js/Express js server and API. It was already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.

This was a bit challenging for me to get working correctly even thought I thought I had parts correct. I was unable to get the login and sign up to work correctly using GraphQL API and Apollo but I hope to come back to this and complete it.
